            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907 - 23 March 1931) was a fearless Indian freedom fighter who played a pivotal role in the struggle against British colonial rule. Born in Banga, Punjab, Bhagat Singh was deeply influenced by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the sacrifices of prominent leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai.</p>
            <p>Bhagat Singh's commitment to the cause of independence led him to join the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA). He believed in the power of revolutionary actions to awaken the masses and bring about change. His ideologies were shaped by the desire for a socialist and secular India.</p>
            <p>One of the most significant incidents in Bhagat Singh's life was the Lahore Conspiracy Case, where he and his associates sought revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. Despite being given the death sentence, Bhagat Singh faced the gallows with unwavering courage, turning his trial into a platform for expressing his revolutionary ideals.</p>
            <p>Bhagat Singh's sacrifice left an indelible mark on India's struggle for independence, inspiring future generations to fight for justice, equality, and freedom.</p>
